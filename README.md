## JavaScrpit, HTML and further code explanation

Each section of our project has been created using mainly JavaScript, JSON and HTML. We created files and folders that held the appropriate data and functions for each correlating section. The first thing we did for this project was created a Wireframe using Figma and a DBDiagram allowing us to make connections we needed between our States and SavedInfo. By doing so we were able to make our website look the closest to our desired outcome as possible. By using JavaScript and JSON we were able to link all park, bazzararies and eateries to a 'Save Trip" button that makes our website look more enticing for our current influencer, Brittany.
